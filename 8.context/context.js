//In general we first declare the functions then we call them
//if we call before declaring the function it gives error 

//But in JS we can do that because of global context 
//Js do when ever what ever where ever you declare a function and you can call the them where ever

//Example

//Calling the cunction before declaring the function but its work perfect
hello()

function hello(){
    console.log("Hello hemanth");
}

//Calling the fucntion after declaring the funtion its working perfect
hello()


//Context gives full understanding of code clearly 
//With this debuggin code makes easy

 //Important points

 //Function declarations are scanned and made available
 //Variavle declarations are scanned and made undefined


 //For normal functions 
 //We can call funciton before declaring and also we call funciton after declarations

 //But  varabile functions
 //We can't call varabile function before declaring function in a variable
//We can call varabile function after declaring varabile function.
